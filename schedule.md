<strong>09:00-09:30 Welcome and Introduction to SemEval</strong>: by Workshop Chairs

<strong>09:30-10:30 Invited Talk, [Emily Allaway](https://emilyallaway.github.io/): Lessons in generics: how language models grapple with human generalisation</strong>
<details><summary>Talk information</summary>

The ability to generalise is a crucial aspect of human cognition, allowing us to derive broader understandings from specific instances. In language, generalised knowledge over particular instantiations and exceptions can be flexibly expressed through generics â€” generalisations without quantifiers. However, the flexibility of generics also comes with puzzling properties that have been extensively studied in areas such as linguistics and philosophy of language. This talk will explore the specific challenges that this language of generalisation poses for language models (LMs).  I will begin by examining whether language models recognise the quantificational variation inherent in generics. Specifically, I will discuss how accurately LMs process and recognise the quantification in generic expressions, with a particular focus on the phenomenon of overgeneralisation â€” unwarranted universal quantification. One critical area of overgeneralisation is with stereotypes and I will touch on the implications for LMs of stereotypes that are expressed as generics. 
Next, I will present evaluations on the capacity of LMs to reason about generics and related examples, probing LMsâ€™ ability to both maintain and override their generalisations. In the final part of the talk, I will expand the discussion to visual-language models (VLMs) to determine whether their struggles with generics mirror those of traditional LMs and what the broader implications of these findings might be.

Bio: Emily Allaway is a Chancellorâ€™s Fellow at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Informatics, where she is affiliated with both Edinburgh NLP and the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC). Her research is on reasoning about and understanding implicit meaning in language, with a recent focus on generics and their role in reasoning. Emily received her PhD from Columbia University under the supervision of Kathleen McKeown. Her doctoral work there was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Her previous work includes research positions at the University of Washington, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and Amazon Science. She is currently a chair for the WiNLP workshop.
